To create the tables/database from the model, use the follow commands on Package Manager Console

-Run "Add-Migration InitialCreate" to scaffold a migration to create the initial set of tables for the model.
-Run "Update-Database" to apply the new migration to the database. Because the database doesn't exist yet, it will be created before the migration is applied.

Tip
If you make changes to the model, you can use the Add-Migration command to scaffold a new migration to make the corresponding schema changes to the database. Once you have checked the scaffolded code (and made any required changes), you can use the Update-Database command to apply the changes to the database. 
EF uses a __EFMigrationsHistory table in the database to keep track of which migrations have already been applied to the database.
